          <h2>About</h2>
          <p>I&rsquo;m a front end developer with more than 5 years&rsquo; experience crafting interesting and unusual websites which are on-brand and responsive.</p>
          <h4>I create...</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>succinct, semantially decisive HTML</li>
            <li>Javascript that&rsquo;s both creative and sensible</li>
            <li>CSS backed by a &ldquo;breadth and specificity&rdquo; of skills (according to a client)</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Together, these three skills help me to create websites that are accessible, usable and aesthetically pleasing.</p>
          <p>I&rsquo;m obsessed with code. I set up <a href="http://fesuffolk.co.uk">FESuffolk</a>, a front-end user group based in my home town of Ipswich. The group meets every month to talk tech and share presentations based on front-end development and design.</p>
          <p>On top of this, I&rsquo;m always reading and researching around my field. I&rsquo;m adept at spotting and embracing the best new techniques, and avoiding the ones that are just fads. As a result, I&rsquo;m confident that the work I deliver to my clients is always cutting-edge.</p>
